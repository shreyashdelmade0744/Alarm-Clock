<p align="center">Normal Alarm Clocks are simple where user sets the alarm and simply stops it when it rings, may be person sleeps immediately after stopping the sound, but performing some activity can drive away sleep.With this aim we made Alarm Clock with the fusion of ML object detection model using TensorFlow.In this android application user needs to detect a object present on screen to stop alarming. </p>
